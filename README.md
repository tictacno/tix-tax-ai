An AI for tix.tax (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe)

This AI focuses on an AlphaZero approach to Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, using MCTS and an evaluation neural network to drive play. 

The general approach for creating this AI is largely based off of an article by Tim Wheeler: http://tim.hibal.org/blog/alpha-zero-how-and-why-it-works/ and the DeepMind preprint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf
